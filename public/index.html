          Language: Javascript <br />Utilize: <br />
          <span class="tab"></span>Node.js v14.16.1 <br />
          <span class="tab"></span>Express.js <br />
          <span class="tab"></span>Postman v9.1.3

          <h3>How to start the web service:</h3> Download the project from the
          repository at my
          <a href="https://github.com/rmschick99/fetchBackendExercise.git"><b>github</b></a> <br /><br>
          Open favorite IDE and open a terminal to the root directory 
          
          <br><br> run: 'npm install' to
          install modules and dependencies 
          <br>run : 'node app.js' to start the web service 
          <br><br>
          <h3>Navigating the web service:</h3> 
          <b>Transaction: localhost:3000/</b>
          <br>
           From what I know of industry standard/testing with the experience I have, I decided to go with Postman for the POST method when it came to transaction. It's easy, quick, and gives a developer more testing tools and insight into what really is going on. 
           I believe its more true to what backend development would be in a company than to retrieve information from the URL or a user without a frontend. 
          <br><br>To add transactions to the web server, start and run the web service, open up Postman, and create a new workspace
          <br>In the input line marked 'Enter request URL' enter 'localhost:3000/transaction'
          <br>Go to 'Body' and select 'raw' and change to 'JSON'
          <br><br>The template to add a transaction is as follows:
          <br>{
          <br><span class="tab"></span>"payer" : "USERINPUT",
          <br><span class="tab"></span>"points" : NUMBER,
          <br><span class="tab"></span>"timestamp" : "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
          <br>{
          <br>
          Click 'Send'
          <br>This will allow the user to use the other commands to spend points and check the balances.
          <br><br>
           
          <b>Spend: localhost:3000/</b> 
          <br>
          Again, I went with Postman for the POST method when it came to spend. It's easy, quick, and gives a developer more testing tools and insight into what really is going on. It makes sense to send a request to spend points with a POST method.
          <br><br>
          The spend route will spend the points of the payers if there is enough points to cover the request.
          <br><br>
          After starting and running the web service,
          open up Postman and create a new workspace 
          <br><br>
          In the input line marked
          'Enter request URL' 
          <br>enter 'localhost:3000/spend' 
          <br>Go to 'Body' and
          select 'raw' and change to 'JSON' 
          <br>
          For testing purposes I went with
          {"points": 5000} as the input text 
          <br> Click send and the response will be
          recorded in the Body at the bottom. 
          <br><br>
          <b>Balance: localhost:3000/balance</b>
          <br>This route is a 'GET' route made to simply check the balances of
          the payers. This should show the total balance of each payer that has been added
          through the transaction path
